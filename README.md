- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vlad Kovalchuk, and I have been working as a QA Engineer for over two years.
- ðŸ‘€  Iâ€™m interested in Automated Testing. 
Why would I like to learn Automated Testing? 
First, because I love testing itself. 
Secondly, I like to write code. The feeling that I'm creating something new out of nothing using only my skills and my computer is amazing. 
Finally, I love to learn something new, acquire new skills, and develop as a professional.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java.
